# Automated Dataset Generation using Python Executable

## Overview
This project automates the process of generating datasets by leveraging a Python executable that processes a set of large input files according to configurable parameters. The application is designed to streamline data processing workflows by automatically extracting and calculating only the required fields, generating an output file that is ready for immediate use. This eliminates the need for manual intervention, making the process efficient and user-friendly.





## Note

The exe file of the script is generated but could not able to upload this due to the git file size restrictions. Make sure to run the script or run the exe file that can find it at the Google drive: 
## How It Works

### Input Files: 
The user provides a set of input files that need to be processed. These files are specified in a configuration Excel file, which guides the application on how to handle each input.
### Configuration Setup: 
The configuration file contains the paths and parameters needed to process the input files. This file is the only setup required by the user before running the executable.
### Execution: 
Once the configuration is set, the user runs the Python executable. The executable automatically processes the input files based on the instructions in the configuration file.
### Output Generation:
The application processes the data, extracts only the necessary fields, and performs any required calculations. The final output is an Excel file that is fully processed and ready for use, requiring no further input from the user. 
## Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

Openpyxl

Numpy
## How to Run the Project

1. Install Python and pip:
2. Clone the Repository:

    git clone 
    
    Open terminal/cmd prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.

    cd /path_to_directory/Automated_Dataset_Generation

3. Execute the File:

    python automated_dataset_generator.exe
4. View the output:

    The processed output file will be automatically generated and saved in the specified output directory, ready for use.

## Output
The final output is an Excel file containing the processed data, with only the required fields calculated and included. This file is fully prepared and can be used immediately for further analysis or reporting.
